Time Complexity Of Sorting Algorithms
Understanding the time complexity of different sorting techniques will lead to a good understanding of the time complexity.

1. Selection Sort
It has O(n^2) time complexity in the best case, the average case as well as in the worst case.

2. Merge Sort
It has O(NlogN) time complexity in the best case, the average case as well as in the worst case.

3. Bubble Sort
This is the simplest sorting algorithm. it has an O(n^2) time complexity in both the worst as well as best-case.

4. Quick Sort
It has O(NlogN) complexity in the best and average case. But in the worst case, it becomes O(N^2).

5. Heap Sort
It has O(NlogN) time complexity in the best case, the average case as well as in the worst case.

6. Bucket Sort
It has O(N+k) complexity in the best and average case. But in the worst case, it becomes O(N^2).

7. Insertion Sort
The time complexity of the insertion sort algorithm in the best case is O(n) and in the worst case, it is O(n^2).
